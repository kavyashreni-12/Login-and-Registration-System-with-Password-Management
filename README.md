## Login and Registration System with Password Management

### Tech Stack:
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **GUI Framework**: Tkinter
- **Data Storage**: JSON
- **Validation Techniques**: CAPTCHA and Password Policy

### Project Overview:
Developed a secure and user-friendly **Login and Registration System** using Python's Tkinter library. This project emphasizes user authentication and account management, featuring functionalities like CAPTCHA validation, password change, and account deletion. User data is persistently stored in JSON files, ensuring seamless access to login credentials across sessions.

### Key Features:
- **Registration System**: Implements robust password validation, requiring passwords to contain at least 8 characters, including uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters.
  
- **Login with CAPTCHA Validation**: Users must solve a CAPTCHA to enhance security during the login process. Clear error messages guide users if credentials are incorrect or if they are not registered.
  
- **Post-login Account Management**:
  - **Change Password**: Enables users to update their passwords with real-time validation to ensure accuracy.
  - **Delete Account**: Provides a confirmation prompt before deleting an account, safeguarding against accidental deletions.
  
- **Show Password Feature**: Users can toggle password visibility for convenience during login and registration.

- **Interactive UI Design**: Constructed with Tkinter, featuring frames and dynamic elements for a visually appealing and responsive user interface.

- **Persistent Data Storage**: Securely manages all user credentials using a JSON-based system.

### Challenges Solved:
- **Data Validation and Security**: Implemented CAPTCHA and stringent password policies to prevent unauthorized access.
  
- **User-Friendly Interaction**: Designed an intuitive GUI with clear instructions and feedback, facilitating a smooth user experience.
  
- **Dynamic Functionality**: The login form refreshes post-registration to display relevant options such as Change Password and Delete Account, enhancing usability.

### Project Impact & Learning Outcome:
This project showcases my practical experience in developing real-world authentication systems while enhancing user experience through effective password management solutions. The implementation of CAPTCHA and password validation aligns with industry security best practices, and the interactive GUI illustrates my front-end design skills using Python. Overall, this project has deepened my knowledge in user management, GUI development, file handling, and validation techniques, equipping me with skills directly applicable to modern software development.
